## Project Overview

This project presents the design and AC performance analysis of a **Telescopic CMOS Operational Amplifier** implemented using the **SkyWater 130nm (Sky130A) Process Design Kit**.

The schematic is created in **Xschem**, and simulations are performed using **NGSpice**. The primary goal is to study the amplifier’s **high-gain behavior**, **frequency response**, and the effect of **bias voltages**, **tail current**, and **transistor sizing (W/L ratios)** on overall performance.

## Circuit Architecture

The telescopic operational amplifier is a **single-stage, high-gain topology** that employs **cascoding** to increase output resistance and voltage gain.

### Main Building Blocks

- NMOS differential input pair  
- NMOS and PMOS cascode transistors  
- Constant tail current bias source  
- Single-ended output node

- Moderate DC gain observed  
- Early gain roll-off  
- Bandwidth limited due to initial biasing and transistor sizing  

### Optimized Gain–Frequency Response
