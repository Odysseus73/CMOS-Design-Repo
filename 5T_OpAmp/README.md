**Tools:** Xschem, Ngspice  
**Supply Voltage:** 1.5 V

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a **5-Transistor Operational Transconductance Amplifier (5T OTA)** using the **SKY130 CMOS process**. The design emphasizes a **low-power**, **minimal-transistor-count** analog amplifier, making it suitable for fundamental analog building blocks and educational VLSI design studies.

The work includes:
- Transistor-level schematic design  
- Biasing and enable-control circuitry  
- AC frequency response analysis  
- DC operating point verification  

---

## OTA Architecture

The 5T OTA consists of the following components:

- NMOS differential input pair  
- PMOS current mirror load  
- Tail current source  
- Enable-controlled biasing network  

This topology provides:
- Low power consumption  
- Compact and area-efficient design  
- Simple biasing, at the cost of limited gain and output swing

**Simulation setup:**
- Differential AC excitation  
- Output load capacitance: **50 fF**  
- Frequency sweep range: **1 kHz – 100 MHz**

The AC frequency response of the OTA shows stable single-pole behavior.

### Observed Performance

- **DC Gain:** ~30–32 dB  
- **Dominant Pole:** ~1 MHz (approx.)  
- **Gain Roll-Off:** −20 dB/dec  
- **Unity Gain Frequency:** ~10–20 MHz  

The response confirms stable operation characteristic of a single-stage OTA.

## DC Operating Point

DC operating point analysis confirms:
- All transistors operate in saturation  
- Proper bias voltages across both NMOS and PMOS devices  
- Reliable operation under a **1.5 V** supply
